# Docker example stacks

This repository contains a curated list of stacks to showcase the docker images
available in the public docker registry.

You can simply grab the current examples and run them with [docker stack deploy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/) or [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
to have a fully functional environments.

## Submitting a new stack

To submit a stack just open a PR against this repo with the following folder structure:

`/<name>/<repository>/<tag>/<stack.yml>`

In the case of official repositories, `<name>` is not necessary. If you're submitting a new stack,
make sure the default name is `stack.yml`. 

When submitting new stacks it's important to find an intuitive way to showcase the example you're aiming at.
For example, if adding a stack for a DB, try to also add a web interface container so it's easier to play with it.
